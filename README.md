**Domain:** Food Delivery & Consumer Analytics

QuickBite Express is a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup (founded in 2020) that connects customers with nearby restaurants and cloud kitchens.

In June 2025, QuickBite faced a major crisis. A viral social media incident involving food safety violations at partner restaurants, combined with a week-long delivery outage during the monsoon season, triggered massive customer backlash. Competitors capitalized with aggressive campaigns, worsening the situation.

The challenges were severe: 

1. A large portion of active users disengaged within a short period. 

2. Daily orders saw a sharp decline compared to earlier months. 

3. Customer satisfaction scores fell sharply, signaling trust issues. 

4. Many partner restaurants shifted to competing platforms. 

5. Customer acquisition costs rose significantly.
